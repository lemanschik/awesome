## Build Storage
The build Storage is the most Awesome Part about this Project thats why it is using something called Awesome OS

Awesome OS is a collection of components that build up the main parts of a nativ host system like network/sync/versioning/storage
And offers awesome generic interfaces to reuse the storage in a variaty of Program able ways. In fact Awesome OS is a Couchbase
Compatible Platform that is a drop in Replacement for the Couchbase Platform it self. It Offers all futures of Couchbase Server, Couchbase Sync Gateway
but directly based on the web Platform. It even uses the same couchdb sync protocol and binary exchange protocols like the datacenter replication
protocol or the fleece datastructure..... 

This makes it a Awesome OS powered Distributed Storage that hosts the chromium source code to offer advanced code refactoring and incremental 
rebuilds and even Hot Reload for the Chromium Build it self. 

This Awesome Storage Concept allows partial checkouts of the chromium source while working with it.
