# components-manager/cloud

This is currently the main dev for the cloud interface it should later get upstreamed to submodule/cloud to be indipendent
maintainable. At present it is more convinient for me to directly work here in the module and link it inside components
Later i should link the submodule into components. and delete the module branch here as it has a own repo already.
