# This Branch contains nodejs compatible packages some Tracking Git Submodules
It is mainly used to split of worktrees from it and then commit the worktrees as new branch
that does not depend any more on the submodules branch most best and this way get a submodule of

components branch which is factored out of submodules and indipendent/branch for production use

This mainly exists because many people do use this format to author code once we have better git support
we can more easy adopt and refactor the code.
