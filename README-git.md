## Goals
Replace a large list of implementations via a declarative simple one:
- [ ] rollup
- [ ] docker / runc lib container management
- [ ] git
- [ ] ipfs
- [ ] beakerbrowers (hyperdrive)
- [ ] monaco-editor
- [ ] typescript
- [ ] eslint

- [ ] chromium and all dependencies and dependents
- [ ] linux kernel
- [ ] mach kernel
- [ ] windows kernel driver

## Development

This Branch Tracks Git Submodules and ECMAScript Modules as so called components
It is mainly used to split of worktrees from it and then commit the worktrees as new branch
that does not depend any more on the submodules branch most best and this way get a submodule of

components branch which is factored out of submodules and indipendent/branch for production use.
